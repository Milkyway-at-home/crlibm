TODO before 1.0 release


Serious bugs
------------
No known serious bug left so far. Exception raising should be improved.

New functions
-------------
Add asinpi and acospi.
Document power (after all, it does return 
   guaranteed correctly rounded values for quite a few inputs).

Proof stuff
-----------
Write Gappa proofs for log2-td, log10-td, asin, acos, expm1, log1p
Check all the existing .gappa against last version of Gappa
 + set the paths right (where there are paths). 
Write proper proofs of the DE integer rounding tests, or remove DE altogether.


Cleaning up stuff
-----------------
Check .mpl with underscored variables (some versions of Maple don't like them)
Ensure compilation on icc9 and SunStudio11
Solution: check recent icc first. Then add FMADE macros everywhere FMA intended
add make timings

Autotest stuff
--------------
You never have enough test cases. 
More cases around the various boundaries would be welcome.

Optim stuff
-----------
Remove remaining SCS: in atan, in trigo.
Minor improvements to atanpi as mentionned in the doc. 
Fuse atan-pentium and atan-itanium into atan-de, and add in atanpi. 
Or maybe remove all the DE stuff altogether for cleaning up.

===========================================================================

TODO some day

New functions
-------------
inverse hyperbolic
Difficult: power

Optimisation stuff
------------------
Write TD versions of: trigo
Write DE versions of: most functions


Use technique in paper by Karp and Markstein for sqrt12 and sqrt13


Interval stuff
--------------
Write interval functions for each CR function
