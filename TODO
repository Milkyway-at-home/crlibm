TODO before 0.14 release (which will be 1.0)


Serious bugs
------------
No known serious bug left so far. Exception raising should be improved.

Proof stuff
-----------
Write Gappa proofs for log2-td, log10-td, asin, acos, expm1, log1p
Check all the existing .gappa against last version of Gappa
 + set the paths right in the .mpls 
   (not done when we moved the .gappa from maple/ to gappa/) 
Write proofs of the DE integer rounding tests.


Cleaning up stuff
-----------------
Check .mpl with underscored variables (some versions of Maple don't like them)
Ensure compilation on icc9 and SunStudio11
At the moment, on itanium/icc, log-de only compiles without -mp-std=c99, and 4 of the other ones only compile with these options.
Solution: check recent icc first. Then add FMADE macros everywhere FMA intended
add make timings
On x86, the test procedure is unfair to the default libm : it should put the processor back to its default state.  ? Seems OK to me. Which test procedure ?

Autotest stuff
--------------
Add some of Vincent's worst cases to acos, expm1, log1p, log2 and log10 testdata

Optim stuff
-----------
Fuse atan-pentium and atan-itanium into atan-de

===========================================================================

TODO some day

New functions
-------------
Easy: 2^x, 10^x, trigpi
Moderate:  inverse hyperbolic
Difficult: power

Optimisation stuff
------------------
Write TD versions of: trigo
Write DE versions of: most functions


Use technique in paper by Karp and Markstein for sqrt12 and sqrt13


Interval stuff
--------------
Write interval functions for each CR function
