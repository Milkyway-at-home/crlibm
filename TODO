TODO before 0.10 release (will we call it 1.0?)

Proof stuff
-----------
Write proofs for log2-td, log10-td
Check all the existing .gappa against last version of Gappa
 + set the paths right in the .mpls 
   (not done when we moved the .gappa from maple/ to gappa/) 
Write proofs of the DE integer rounding tests.


Cleaning up stuff
-----------------
Check .mpl with underscored variables (some versions of Maple don't like them)
Replace calls to expSCS in csh.c with calls to functions in exp-td
Check icc 9
At the moment, on itanium/icc, log-de only compiles without -mp-std=c99, and 4 of the other ones only compile with these options.
Solution: add FMADE macros everywhere FMA intended
add make timings

Autotest stuff
--------------
Add some of Vincent's worst cases to log2 and log10 testdata

Optim stuff
-----------
Fuse atan-pentium and atan-itanium into atan-de


===========================================================================

TODO some day

New functions
-------------
Easy: 2^x, 10^x
Moderate: inverse trigs, inverse hyperbolic
Difficult: power

Optimisation stuff
------------------
Write TD versions of: csh, trigo
Write DE versions of: exp, csh, trigo

Interval stuff
--------------
Write interval functions for each CR function
