        Added crlibm_exit()
	
Changes between version 0.8beta and version 0.2:

	Added functions : sin cos tan atan sinh cosh

	Changed Maple files from .mw and .mws to .mpl

	Added FMA support in crlibm_private.h

	Added polish to some of the proofs

	Improved performance tests for tighter timing, 

	Fairer speed comparison to mpfr: We now compare to mpfr with
	 53-bit mantissa, although this doesnot provide correct rounding
	 if the result is a denormal (double rounding). Previously we
	 compared to 150-bit mpfr.

Version 0.2 : exp and log
