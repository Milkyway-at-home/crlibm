Summary of changes between version 0.8beta3 and version 0.8beta2
==========================================================
       
<Florent de Dinechin>
        Added crlibm_blindtest and automatic testsuite
	Consequently corrected quite a few bugs in extreme cases
	Cleant up cosh and sinh

Summary of changes between version 0.8beta2 and version 0.8beta
==========================================================
       
<David Defour and Florent de Dinechin>
	Rewritten faster trigonometric functions
<Florent de Dinechin>
        Added crlibm_blindtest and automatic testsuite 
        Added crlibm_exit()
	crlibm_init() now returns the old processor status flag
	Proof for the trigonometric functions
<Philippe Defert>
	Added crlibm.spec file to build rpms
	
Summary of changes between version 0.8beta and version 0.2:
==========================================================

<Catherine Daramy & Florent de Dinechin>
	Added functions : sin cos tan

<Nicolas Gast>
	Added function atan 
	Added function atan specialized for pentium (atan-pentium.c)

<Matthieu Gallet>
	Added functions sinh cosh

<Florent de Dinechin>
	Changed Maple files from .mw and .mws to .mpl
	Added FMA support in crlibm_private.h
	Added polish to some of the proofs
	Improved performance tests for tighter timing, 
	Fairer speed comparison to mpfr: We now compare to mpfr with
	 53-bit mantissa, although this doesnot provide correct rounding
	 if the result is a denormal (double rounding). Previously we
	 compared to 150-bit mpfr.

Version 0.2 : exp and log
