Summary of changes between version 0.8beta4 and version 0.8beta3
==========================================================
       
<Florent de Dinechin>
        Added crlibm_generate_test_vectors
	Added test vectors to all functions, including some of Lefevre/Muller worst cases
	Cleant up the accurate trig functions, now in trigo.c
	Cleant up cosh and sinh
	Added Gappa input file to assist the proof of the trig functions
<Patrice Pelissier>
	Added AMD64 architecture to autoconf stuff
	Improved timings on x86


Summary of changes between version 0.8beta3 and version 0.8beta2
==========================================================
       
<Florent de Dinechin>
        Added crlibm_blindtest and automatic testsuite
	Consequently corrected quite a few bugs in extreme cases
	Cleant up cosh and sinh

Summary of changes between version 0.8beta2 and version 0.8beta
==========================================================
       
<David Defour and Florent de Dinechin>
	Rewritten faster trigonometric functions
<Florent de Dinechin>
        Added crlibm_blindtest and automatic testsuite 
        Added crlibm_exit()
	crlibm_init() now returns the old processor status flag
	Proof for the trigonometric functions in progress
<Philippe Defert>
	Added crlibm.spec file to build rpms  to the CVS
	
Summary of changes between version 0.8beta and version 0.2:
==========================================================

<Catherine Daramy & Florent de Dinechin>
	Added functions : sin cos tan

<Nicolas Gast>
	Added function atan 
	Added function atan specialized for pentium (atan-pentium.c)

<Matthieu Gallet>
	Added functions sinh cosh

<Florent de Dinechin>
	Changed Maple files from .mw and .mws to .mpl
	Added FMA support in crlibm_private.h
	Added polish to some of the proofs
	Improved performance tests for tighter timing, 
	Fairer speed comparison to mpfr: We now compare to mpfr with
	 53-bit mantissa, although this doesnot provide correct rounding
	 if the result is a denormal (double rounding). Previously we
	 compared to 150-bit mpfr.

Version 0.2 : exp and log
